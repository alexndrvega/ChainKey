# ChainKey
Packet encryption system, data is segmented into chuncks. 
Chuncks are randomized, this ransomized pattern is used as part of the encryption key.
If an interception attempt is made the randomized chain of packets is voided.

> **Warning** 
> Do not attempt to use this library for encryption in production.

> I am building it in public and as a learning experience.
